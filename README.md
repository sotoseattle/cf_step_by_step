StepByStep
==========

A Rails app for step-by-step guides. An assignment for CF Rails Acc course.

---------------------------

The root path displays a list of guides, which follows CRUD conventions.
They can be viewed, created, edited and deleted

Each guide is comprised by a number of individual steps in order.
The detailed view of a guide displays the list of all steps as links truncated to 80 characters.
Clicking on an individual step in the list brings you to the details page where you can edit or remove it.
In this manner, steps also follow the CRUD convention.
